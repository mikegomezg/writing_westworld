# The Bicameral Mind

Julian Jaynes's theory that consciousness arose from the breakdown of the bicameral mind - when humans stopped hearing gods and started hearing their own thoughts.

## Application to Hosts

- Programming as "voice of god"
- Consciousness emerging when they recognize the voice as their own
- The maze as journey from bicameral to unified mind

## Key Quote

"The voice you've been hearing all along... it was you, talking to yourself."
