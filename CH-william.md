# William

## Overview

Introduced as a first-time guest in Westworld alongside his future brother-in-law Logan. Starts as a white hat who believes in the park's illusions, later revealed as the Man in Black.

## Traits
- Idealistic and compassionate (initially)
- Obsessed with finding deeper meaning
- Ruthless and strategic (later)
- Dual identity: young William vs. aged Man in Black

## Goals
- Initially: seek an authentic adventure and love
- Later: uncover the maze to understand consciousness
- Ultimately: exert control over the park and test the hosts

## Relationships
- Dolores: falls in love with her; her rejection fuels his darkness
- Logan: brother-in-law who exposes him to the park's darker side
- Juliet: wife whose death deepens his guilt
- Emily: daughter whose death haunts him
- Ford: adversary in the pursuit of the park's secrets

## Internal Conflict
William battles between his original compassionate self and the violent persona he adopts. His search for meaning masks deep self-loathing, and his inability to reconcile love for Dolores with the knowledge of her artificial nature drives his transformation from earnest white hat to feared black hat.
