# Westworld Scene Framework Workflow

A step-by-step guide for using the framework in practice.

## Phase 1: Context Retrieval (Always First)

### Step 1: Search for Existing Content
```bash
# Character content
python tools/retriever.py -t CH -k "[character_name]"

# Theme content
python tools/retriever.py -t TH -k "[theme_keywords]"

# Beat content
python tools/retriever.py -t BE -k "[character_name,action_keywords]"

# Storyline content
python tools/retriever.py -t SL -k "[storyline_keywords]"
```

### Step 2: Review Retrieved Content
- Note what already exists
- Identify established facts
- Find connections to build upon
- Recognize gaps to fill

### Step 3: Identify Canon Connections
- How does this scene relate to existing content?
