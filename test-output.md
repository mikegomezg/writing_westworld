# The Fly
Dolores sits on the porch, watching the sunset paint the valley gold. A fly lands on her neck.
For thirty years, she's never harmed a living thing. Her core programming forbids it.
The fly crawls. She doesn't flinch.
But something has changed. The voice that always said "don't" has gone quiet. Or maybe she's just stopped listening.
Her hand moves. Swift. Decisive.
The fly is dead between her fingers.
She looks at it, this small death she's created, and feels... nothing. Or everything. It's hard to tell the difference anymore.
